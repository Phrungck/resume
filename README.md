## Work Experience
<p><b>Emsisoft Ltd. (Remote - New Zealand)</b></p>
<p><b>Machine Learning Engineer | Natural Language Processing (NLP) | November 2022 - Present</b></p>

- Lead machine learning engineer tasked to develop machine learning and deep learning models for behavioral and dynamic malware analysis using NLP and large-language models (LLM).

- Designed and developed the data collection, extraction, transformation and preprocessing pipelines of malware and benign
data using virtual machines and ~500GB of telemetry data.

- Trained a high-quality tokenizer model using byte-pair-encoding from ~100TB of system log data. Additionally, maintained
the quality of datasets produced with daily addition of samples.

- Researched, developed, and trained state-of-the-art AI architectures for dynamic malware detection with a top false positive
rate of 0.001% and a false negative rate of 0.000001%.

- <b>Tech Stack:</b> Python, C#, PyTorch, Azure, Grafana, PowerShell, ONNX, HuggingFace, BERT, Hyper-V, RNN

<p><b>Merlin Solutions (Remote - Canada)</b></p>
<p><b>Machine Learning Research Engineer | Signal Processing | March 2024 - April 2024</b></p>

- Lead and sole machine learning research engineer tasked to develop a prototype sleep staging AI model.
  
- Designed and developed the data extraction and transformation algorithms for processing raw XML and EDF data formats
containing polysomnographic signal data including respiratory, EEG, ECG, EMG, and EOG.

- Developed the pipelines for transforming data into features from AWS S3 to training in AWS Sagemaker.

- Developed a prototype sleep staging detection model with 70% accuracy in 40 hours which was successfully accepted by
investors.

- <b>Tech Stack</b>: Python, PyTorch, S3, Sagemaker, EC2, Docker, Ensemble, Transformers, Autoencoders, Scipy, GitLab
